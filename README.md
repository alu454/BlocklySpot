# Boston_Dynamics_Dog_API

**Group Members:** 
Drew Bozarth, Alan Lu, Karen Ngo, Thomas Ogawa

**Motivation and Description:**
The purpose of the project is to develop a domain specific language (DSL) using Blockly. The focus is to develop skills such as parsing, interpreation/compilation, and verification central to the course Programming Languages. Our aim is to create a high-level, user-friendly, visual programming language using the Blockly API to control the Boston Dynamic Dogs. Our goal is to eliminate the barriers associated with traditional programming languages, making the Boston Dynamic Dogs more accessible to students, researchers, and staff who may not have programming/technical expertise. This would allow for a more versatile use of the Boston Dynamic Dogs ranging from research experiments to campus applications. We will be focusing on creating and refining our Blockly block set and designing the user interface. Our Blockly blocks would cover movement, navigation, and interaction with the environment, making it easy for non-programmers to utilize the Boston Dynamic Dogs.
