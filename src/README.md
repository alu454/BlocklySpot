Describes in detail how to run and test and expand upon the code

Step 1: git clone the repo <https://github.com/alu454/BlocklySpot.git>

Step 2: Open the design-blocks.html file

Step 3: Utilize the blockly interface to create a movement sequence for the dog

Step 4: Export the code to a python file

HOW TO RUN WITH SPOT:

Step 1:
Ensure that you are in a folder that contains the downloaded "BlocklySpotCode.py" file from using the BlocklySpot website. If you have already installed the spot-sdk repo, run build1.sh outside of that folder, otherwise run it where you would like to clone the spot-sdk repo ensuring that you are still in a folder with "BlocklySpotCode.py".
Note: You will need to have access to the username and password credentials for the specific Spot you are trying to work with. We will not provide these credentials pubicly and you would need to get permission from administrators in the Chapman Makerspace if you wish to interact with the Spot on campus.

Step 2: Open a new terminal and run build2.sh from outside of the spot-sdk folder to begin the estop which will need to remain on while interacting with Spot.

Step 4: In a new terminal, run build3.sh from outside of the spot-sdk folder to run the custom "BlocklySpotCode.py" file that you have generated. This will connect with Spot and run your custom commands!
